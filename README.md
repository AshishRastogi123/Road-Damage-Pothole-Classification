# Road-Damage-Pothole-Classification


## 📌 Project Overview
The **Road Damage & Pothole Detection** system is an AI-powered web platform that detects and classifies road surface issues such as cracks and potholes using **deep learning and image processing**.  
It aims to assist local authorities and citizens in identifying road damages early to improve road maintenance and safety.

## 🚀 Features

### 🌐 Frontend
- Developed a **responsive user interface** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- Added **smooth animations** and interactive UI elements for better visualization.
- Designed intuitive pages for image upload, detection result display, and insights visualization.

### ⚙️ Backend
- Working on **backend integration** using **Flask/Django (your choice)** for handling image uploads and model prediction APIs.
- Setting up endpoints to connect the **deep learning model** with the frontend for real-time detection.

### 🧠 Deep Learning Model
- Loaded dataset folder containing various road images (damaged and undamaged).
- Imported essential libraries: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `NumPy`, `OpenCV`, and `Matplotlib`.
- Performed **image preprocessing**, including:
  - Image **resizing**
  - **Rotation handling**
  - **Normalization**
- Preparing model architecture for classification/detection (CNN/YOLO-based).
